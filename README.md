Uber is a ride-hailing company that relies heavily on data science and analysis to support its day-to-day operations and provide hassle-free rides and deliveries to customers. Data science is a critical component of Uber's operations
In this project, we will use a dataset containing the Uber rides of a single user in 2016. 
It consists of 1155 Uber rides with details like start time, end time, miles, location, category, etc. We will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this data to derive insights.
